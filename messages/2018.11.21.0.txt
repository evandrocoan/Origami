* Added release notes (these!) and an install message.

* All settings can now be set in Origami.sublime-settings.
  If you are still using the User settings, Origami will still read those too.

* If you have auto_close_empty_panes enabled, Origami will no longer close panes
  when transient views are closed. This fixes a bug where you couldn't use the
  command palette to open a file in a new pane you just created.
